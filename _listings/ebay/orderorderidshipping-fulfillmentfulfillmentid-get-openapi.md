      summary: Add Order Order Shipping Fulfillment
      description: 'When you group an order''s line items into one or more packages,
        each package requires a corresponding plan for handling, addressing, and shipping;
        this is a shipping fulfillment. For each package, execute this call once to
        generate a shipping fulfillment associated with that package. Note: A single
        line item in an order can consist of multiple units of a purchased item, and
        one unit can consist of multiple parts or components. Although these components
        might be provided by the manufacturer in separate packaging, the seller must
        include all components of a given line item in the same package.Before using
        this call for a given package, you must determine which line items are in
        the package. If the package has been shipped, you should provide the date
        of shipment in the request. If not provided, it will default to the current
        date and time.'
